Project Title: Random Forest Model for Automobile Efficiency Prediction

Description:
This project aims to build a Random Forest model to predict automobile efficiency based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and others. The model utilizes a dataset containing information about automobiles and their corresponding efficiencies.

Files Included:
1. `automobile_efficiency_dataset.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the Random Forest model. It includes features such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and efficiency.

2. `random_forest_model.py`: This Python script contains the code for building and evaluating the Random Forest model. It loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model to a file.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the `random_forest_model.py` script. You can install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Instructions:
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Ensure that `automobile_efficiency_dataset.csv` and `random_forest_model.py` are in the same directory.

3. Run the `random_forest_model.py` script. This will preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model to a file named `random_forest_model.pkl`.

4. Once the model is trained and saved, you can use it for predicting automobile efficiency by loading it into your Python environment and passing new data.

Example Usage:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')

# Example data for prediction
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'engine_size': [2.0],
    'horsepower': [150],
    'weight': [3000]
})

# Make predictions
predicted_efficiency = model.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted efficiency:", predicted_efficiency)
```

Note: Replace the example data (`engine_size`, `horsepower`, and `weight`) with your own data for prediction.
